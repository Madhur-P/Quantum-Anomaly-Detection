This project presented a hybrid approach to multiclass anomaly detection by integratingclassical machine learning with quantum kernel-based classification. A Classical SVM(SVC)model and a Quantum SVM using an OvR strategy were implemented and evaluatedonselected attack classes of the NSL-KDD dataset. The results demonstrate that bothmodelsachieve comparable overall accuracy; however, the quantum model provides significantlybetter performance on minority classes and achieves a substantially higher macro F1-score.<br>

The Quantum SVM showed strong capability in distinguishing low-frequency anomalies suchas ipsweep, achieving perfect classification where the classical model struggled. Thishighlights the potential advantage of quantum feature spaces in capturing subtle patterns andimproving class balance in uneven datasets. On the other hand, the classical SVMremainedfar more computationally efficient, training and predicting in milliseconds comparedtothemuch longer kernel computation times required by the quantum model.<br>

Overall, the findings suggest that quantum machine learning can complement classical techniques, particularly in scenarios involving class imbalance or complex decisionboundaries. While current quantum simulators incur high computational cost, futureadvancements in quantum hardware are expected to make such models more practical. Thisproject demonstrates that quantum-enhanced approaches can offer meaningful improvementsin anomaly detection tasks and represent a promising direction for future researchincybersecurity and machine learning.
